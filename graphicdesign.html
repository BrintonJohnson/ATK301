			<h2>Graphic Design</h2>
				<p>These are designs I made in Intro to Graphic Design at Lincoln Land Community College and Expanded Media I at Illinois State. I took Intro to Graphic Design in the Spring of 2019 and Expanded Media in the Spring of 2020.</p>

							<h3>Baby</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a baby I made using Illustrator. I based it on a picture of a real baby and made it for a contest. I won the contest for my age group, so the graphic now belongs to an organization called Springfield RTL.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">
							<a href="rtlsubmission.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
								<img src="rtlsubmission.png" alt="This is an image of a baby in a heart shape. There is a quote that says, Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you; before you were born, I set you apart.">
							</a>
						</div>

							<h3>Video Game Pixel Art</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is pixel art I made to look like a classic video game. I wanted to make some pixel art one day, so I looked up how to do it and created this.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">
							<a href="spacepixelart.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
								<img src="spacepixelart.png" alt="This is an 8-bit image of a space ship flying toward three small ships in outer space.">
							</a>
						</div>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Dragon</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a dragon design I made in Expanded Media. I drew inspiration from dragons in Chinese culture. The design was meant to be cut out as a vellum sticker. It didn't work quite right, but I still have the digital design.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">
							<a href="dragon.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
								<img src="dragon.png" alt="This is an image of a Chinese dragon head inside a circular, mandala-like pattern.">
							</a>
						</div>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Giotto's Bell Tower</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a digital replica of Giotto's bell tower in Florence, Italy. I made it in Expanded Media. I was assigned to make a design based on nature or architecture, and the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore is one of my favorite buildings. I drew the tower as one of my sketches and recieved positive feedback, so I went with it.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">
							<a href="giottobelltower.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
								<img src="giottobelltower.png" alt="This is a purple and blue design of Giotto's bell tower from the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, Italy.">
							</a>
						</div>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Stairway</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a picture of stairs becoming progressively more cartoon-like. I made it in Expanded Media. I wanted to make it look like reality was shifting to some cartoon world through the stairway.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">
							<a href="stairway.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
								<img src="stairway.png" alt="This is a picture of stairs becoming progressively more cartoon-like. Part of the image is a photo and part is a group of cartoon shapes.">
							</a>
						</div>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>My Cartoon Self</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a picture of me with my cartoon self. This was my final project for Expanded Media. I made my cartoon self give me a mask to tell a story of living during the Coronavirus shutdown.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">
							<a href="mycartoonself.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
								<img src="mycartoonself.png" alt="This is a picture of stairs becoming progressively more cartoon-like. Part of the image is a photo and part is a group of cartoon shapes.">

							<h3>Google Doodle</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">

						</div>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Animal Icons</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>These are seven icons I made of animals. I made them in Intro to Graphic Design. Since icons are meant to be simple and look like they are part of the same group, my assignment was to make icons made from 13 circles or less. I made them to look like emojis.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">
							<a href="animalicons.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
								<img src="animalicons.png" alt="This is an image of seven animal face icons. There is a dog, cat, cow, horse, frog, elephant, and chicken.">
							</a>
						</div>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Lincoln Magazine Cover</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a magazine cover with Abraham Lincoln. I made this in Intro to Graphic Design. There was a competition to submit a design of Lincoln for the cover of a local magazine. I created a cartoon version of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C. (No, I did not win.)</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">
							<a href="lincolnmagazine.png" data-fancybox="gallery">

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Flipping Hierarchy</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a project I worked on that emphasizes hierarchy in two different ways for a design. I made it in Intro to Graphic Design. I based my designs on a song called, "Bad Meets Evil." The image on the right emphasizes hierarchy on the graphic, and the image on the left emphasizes hierarchy on the title. For this project, the elements of design I was focused on were color and movement.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">
							<a href="flippinghierarchy.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
								<img src="flippinghierarchy.png" alt="On the left, there is an image of a saloon with lightning behind it and a ghost, tumbleweed, and bouncing tire in front of it. It is all within the outline of a fire. The image on the left is a fire with the words, Bad Meets Evil, inside it.">
							</a>
						</div>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>FruitCo Website</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>These are some elements for a website I made for a fake company, called FruitCo. I created the graphics and the website in Intro to Graphic Design. The image at the top left would be the trademark logo and the image at the bottom left were the low-res icons I made for the logo's fruit bowl. I made the website using the website builder, Wix.</p>
							<p>Here is a link to my site:<br><a href="https://bjohn6528.wixsite.com/fruit-icons" target="_blank">https://bjohn6528.wixsite.com/fruit-icons</a></p>

							</a>
						</div>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Business Cards</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>These are possible business card designs I came up with for myself. I made them in Intro to Graphic Design. These were three of my ideas, but the final business card design I went with was the one in the middle. (Also, the back side of the first design had red and yellow circles above the green one, but there was an error exporting it.)</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">
							<a href="businesscards.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
								<img src="businesscards.png" alt="This is an image of business card designs. There are three designs with front sides and back sides to each.">

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>My Personal Logo</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a logo that I created for myself. I made it in Intro to Graphic Design. I had come up with a variety of possible logos, but this is the one I ended up with to define my typical design style. I made it for a different portfolio website that served as the final for my Intro to Graphic Design class. I made the website with Wix.</p>
							<p class="specialp">Here is a link to my Wix portfolio website:<br><a href="https://bjohn6528.wixsite.com/graphicdesign" target="_blank">https://bjohn6528.wixsite.com/graphicdesign</a></p>
