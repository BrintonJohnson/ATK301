						</div>
						<div class="pagep">

						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a drawing of two patterns connecting in the middle; the diamond pattern fades into the swirl pattern, and the swirl pattern overlaps the diamond pattern. I made this piece in Drawing I. I was given two patterns to base my drawing's patterns on, which I put in the lower-left and upper-right corners. Then, I drew outward from there.</p>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Zodiac Bull</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a drawing of a bull made from kitchen utensils and lids. I drew this in Drawing I. First, I organized items from my kitchen to look like my zodiac sign, which is a bull. I took a picture and then drew the bull based on that picture. Finally, I added a bull pattern in the background, which is based on a famous bull cave drawing.</p>

							<h3>Household Collage</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This drawing shows an assortment of household items. This was my Drawing I final project. I was given a list of things I could draw for this assignment. I gathered most of these items and drew them individually. The photograph and watch were drawn based on pictures, though.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Radial Symmetry</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a drawing of a design with horizontal and vertical symmetry. This was made in my 2D Design class. All of the shapes were made symmetrical, but the shading within some of the shapes make those shapes look like they could rotate around the center of the image.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">
							<a href="radialsymmetry.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
								<img src="radialsymmetry.png" alt="This is a marker drawing of a design with radial symmetry. There are circles, triangles, and arrows that are symmetrical vertically and horizontally from the center of the image.">

						</div>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Elements of Design</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a set of small drawings that show combinations of the elements of design. This was made for my 2D Design class. The assignment was to draw eight designs, each based on the combination of two of the elements of design. The first picture is frequency and variation; the second is repetition and static; the third is scale and overlapping; the fourth is direction and movement; the fifth is geometric and negative/positive space; the sixth is horizontal and symmetry; the seventh is vertical and balance; and the eighth is organic and weight.</p>
