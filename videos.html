			<h2>Videos</h2>
				<p>Here are some of the video projects I have worked on for Digital Animation and Film Production I at Lincoln Land and Video II at Illinois State. I took Animation and Film Production in the Fall of 2018 and Video II in the Spring of 2020.</p>
					<div class="pagelayout">

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Motion Text</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This was a video I made for my Video II class. It is a clip from a video game commentary video on YouTube. I animated the text to make it seem like the commentator's text was interacting with the game's text.</p>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Moving Shape</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This was a video I made for my Video II class. I made it in After Effects as a cool shape animation video.</p>
						</div>
						<iframe class="video" width="360" height="202" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_DpGLo4tZQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>The Shot</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This was one of the first videos I made for my Video II class. It was made to show examples of different types of camera shots.</p>
						</div>
						<iframe class="video" width="360" height="202" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r0mDvBvJnQ4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Illinois State Narration</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is another video I made in my Video II class. It is meant to be a short documentary of Illinois State University based on some interesting facts I had researched. It's not that exciting, but I made it to show how I might direct a documentary film like this. I took all of the shots on campus and in downtown Bloomington.</p>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Casino Fight</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This was my final project for Video II. I was allowed to make anything, as long as I used some filming and editing techniques we learned earlier in the semester. I decided to make a funny video with special effects and a green screen.</p>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>The Midnight Visitor</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This was my final project in my Film Production class. I made a horror film because I had a limited number of actors for this film. I filmed, directed, and edited the video myself.</p>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Alien Lands On Earth</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This was the first animation I made for my Animation class. I created the alien in Illustrator and animated him in ToonBoom. This was when I learned about looping backgrounds and squash-and-stretch animation.</p>
						</div>

							<h3>Steve the Alien</h3>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Exploding Sun Animation</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p id="videomargin">This was another short animation I made in my Animation class. It is the first 3D animation I have created. I used Cinema 4D to animate the video.</p>
