			<h2>Game Graphics</h2>
				<p>Here are some video game graphics I have worked on for Game Design I and Game Design II at Lincoln Land and then User Interface/Experience at Illinois State. I took Game Design I in the Spring of 2018, Game Design II in the Spring of 2019, and User Experience in the Spring of 2020.</p>

        <h3>Invasion of the Candy Snatchers</h3>
          <p>This is an app developed for iOS mobile devices that I worked on with my team in Game Design II. There were three of us in this team, and we all had separate jobs. My job was to create the graphics we would put in the game. Unfortunately, I was not able to screen record gameplay because the only copy of the app that I have stopped working. These are most of the graphics I created for the app.</p>

				<h3>The Cycle of Freedom</h3>
					<p>This is a game idea I worked on in my User Experience class. First, I came up with a video game pitch with a Main Menu screen and an In-game screen. Then, I chose to develop a prototype for the game's weapons menu. I drew up some wireframes and created the menu based on the teacher's and other students' feedback. The result was an interactive video game menu that served as the class' final project. I couldn't do as much as I wanted with it because I made it in Adobe XD, but I think it turned out pretty good. Also, this video game was only an idea and was never developed or released.</p>
					<p>Here's a link to my game pitch:<br><a href="file:///C:/Users/brint/Desktop/UI-UX/Game%20Pitch/UI-UX%20Game%20Pitch.pdf" target="_blank">file:///C:/Users/brint/Desktop/UI-UX/Game%20Pitch/UI-UX%20Game%20Pitch.pdf</a></p>
					<p>Here is a link to my interactive game menu:<br><a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/5f8a9156-f7ee-4a56-7b26-bffc12f16337-29bb/" target="_blank">https://xd.adobe.com/view/5f8a9156-f7ee-4a56-7b26-bffc12f16337-29bb/</a>.</p>

						<h3>Cower Tower Defense</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="pagep">
						<p>This is an idea for the main menu of a tower defense game. I made it in my User Experience class. I was assigned the genre, tower defense, so I came up with an app where cartoon knights defend their castle from invaders. The main menu is a design I made to show an intuitive user interface. This game was also just an idea and was never developed or released.</p>

				<h3>Ferris Pawler's Day Off</h3>
					<p>This was the first app I helped create. I helped make it in Game Design I. I wasn't sure if I should put this game on here since I didn't make the graphics, but I did help in its development. I was in a group with two other students in my Game Design I class. One was in charge of graphics, the other was in charge of the game's development, and I was in charge of sound design. All the sound effects in the game were found or created by me, and I made the music in GarageBand, as well.</p>
