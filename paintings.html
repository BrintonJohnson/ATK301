			<h2>Paintings</h2>
				<p>These are paintings I created in 2D Design and Painting I at Lincoln Land Community College. I took 2D Design in the Fall of 2018 and Painting I in the Fall of 2019. I hadn't done much painting before 2D Design, so I was just learning how in that class.</p>

							<h3>Complimentary Painting</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a painting of a red weight on a green cloth. This was my first painting in Painting I. It is a still-life of objects with complimentary colors. This piece was painted on paper.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">

						</div>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Triadic Painting</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a painting of a yellow pear, a red pot lid, and a blue glass bottle. This was my second painting in Painting I. It is another still-life, but this one is of objects with the triadic primary colors. It was painted on canvas that I stretched myself.</p>

						</div>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Microbiology</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a painting of microscopic, biological cells or bacteria. To be honest, I don't know for sure what they are, but the painting was inspired by multiple images of microbiology. I made it in Painting I. It was painted on a wood panel.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">
							<a href="microbiology.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
								<img src="microbiology.png" alt="This is a painting of purple and red bacteria floating in a gradient blue background.">
							</a>
						</div>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Still-Life Final</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a painting of an ornament, a green box, a baseball cap, and a candle. It was my final project for Painting I. I had the choice to paint anything for the final, so I chose to retry painting a still-life. I wanted to make something like my triadic painting but better, using the techniques I had learned throughout the rest of the semester.</p>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Magazine Cutouts</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a painting based on cutouts from a magazine. I made it in 2D Design. First, I cut out pieces of a magazine and glued them to a piece of paper to make a design. Then, I attempted to paint the magazine cutouts. I was still learning to paint during this time.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">
							<a href="magazinecutouts.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
								<img src="magazinecutouts.png" alt="This is a painting of a turquoise gear-like design and a blue background. There are light purple triangles above and below with tree branch patterns on them.">
							</a>
						</div>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Static Painting</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a painting of asymmetrical squares. I made it in 2D Design. It was made to show the asymmetrical and static elements of design.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">
							<a href="staticpainting.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
								<img src="staticpainting.png" alt="This is a painting of asymmetrical gray squares.">

						</div>

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>Symmetry Painting</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p>This is a painting of a geometric design with radial symmetry. I made it in 2D Design. The assignment was for us to show that we know the symmetrical and geometric elements of design.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">
							<a href="symmetrypainting.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
								<img src="symmetrypainting.png" alt="This is a painting of a geometric design with circles, squares, diamonds, and triangles. The design has radial symmetry.">

						<div class="pageh3">
							<h3>The Color Wheel</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="pagep">
							<p class="specialp">This is a painting showing colors' tints, shades, and levels of saturation; there's also a color wheel I painted on the side. I made it in 2D Design. This was one of my first painted pieces. I made it when I was learning the properties of color and learning how to mix paint.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="singleimg">
							<a href="thecolorwheel.png" data-fancybox="gallery">
								<img src="thecolorwheel.png" alt="This is a project with tints, shades, and levels of saturation shown with rows of painted squares. There is also a painted color wheel on the side.">
